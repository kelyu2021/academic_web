Currently, my research focuses on user identification based on biometric information in VR and AR applications. We utilize the dataset of user head movements, which is gathered by most advanced AR/VR devices to enhance immersive experiences, for conducting user identification. This method does not affect the user experience nor does it require additional hardware.

Our algorithm, proposed by my advisor Dr. Xianglong Feng and I, aims to achieve the following requirements:

**1. Use the user head movement data only**

**2. Be able to periodically check the user’s identity in the runtime**

**3. Without Any Impact to the User experience**
